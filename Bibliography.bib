ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, smart mobile devices include more and more sensors on board, such as motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), wireless signal strength indicators (WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee), and visual sensors (LiDAR, camera). People have developed various indoor positioning techniques based on these sensors. In this paper, the probabilistic fusion of multiple sensors is investigated in a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework for mobile-device user-positioning. We propose a graph structure to store the model constructed by multiple sensors during the offline training phase, and a multimodal particle filter to seamlessly fuse the information during the online tracking phase. Based on our algorithm, we develop an indoor positioning system on the iOS platform. The experiments carried out in a typical indoor environment have shown promising results for our proposed algorithm and system design.},

   	abstract = {This technical report describes our evaluation of the Kinect depth sensor by Microsoft for Computer Vision applications. The depth sensor is able to return images like an ordinary camera, but instead of color, each pixel value represents the distance to the point. As such, the sensor can be seen as a range- or 3D-camera. We have used the sensor in several different computer vision projects and this document collects our experiences with the sensor. We are only focusing on the depth sensing capabilities of the sensor since this is the real novelty of the product in relation to computer vision. The basic technique of the depth sensor is to emit an infrared light pattern (with an IR laser diode) and calculate depth from the reflection of the light at different positions (using a traditional IR sensitive camera). In this report, we perform an extensive evaluation of the depth sensor and investigate issues such as 3D resolution and precision, structural noise, multi-cam setups and transient response of the sensor. The purpose is to give the reader a well-founded background to choose whether or not the Kinect sensor is applicable to a specific problem.},
